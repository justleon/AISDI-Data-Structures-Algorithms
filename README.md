## Lab1-Sort
Simple selection and quick sort implementations along with comparison of speed of each algorithm.

## Lab2-Splay
Simple splay tree implementation, packed along with tests.

## Lab3-Heaps
Quaternary heap implementation with tests.  
The "results.txt" file shows pre order traversal in the heap along with 3 pop operations performed after randomizing a couple of values that are stored in the structure.

## Lab4-PatternMatching
The brute force and KMP text searching algorithms.
The difference between "main.cpp" and "solution.cpp" is that the first one performs saving results to file(s), and the second one writes them onto the terminal.
"results.txt" shows the outcome after using key of length 5, "results2.txt" uses key of length 15.

## Lab5-Graphs
Dijkstra algorithm implementation.

## Homework
Homework for algorithms and data structures. Implements node deletion from binary search tree.
